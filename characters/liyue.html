            "<i>The Kangxi Emperor's Southern Inspection Tour, Scroll Three: Ji'nan to Mount Tai</i>" by Wang Hui (<a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/49156" target="_blank">source</a>)<br><br>
            Commissioned by the Kangxi emperor in 1689, Wang Hui recorded the journey of the emperor's grand tour over a
            series of twelve oversize handscrolls. The scroll highlights the Kangxi Emperor's authority in southern China.
            This particular scroll is the third in the set, which highlights the emperor's visit to Mount Tai, where he
            performs rituals acknowledging the mandate of heaven and reaffirming
            his authority as a ruler.<br><br>

              When incorporating the individual buttons to navigate between themes, I made two designs that reflect on traditional and modern aspects of Chinese culture.
              <br><br>
              For the traditional button, I was inspired by Chinese folding screens, a suggestion made by an interviewee who was very fascinated by traditional Chinese aesthetics and designs. Folding screens, also known as píngfēng (屏風), dates back to over a thousand years ago to the Eastern Zhou period (771-256 BCE). They were originally ‘screens,’ a one-panel screen in contrast to the folding screens we know today, while folding screens were invented during the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE). They were originally used for practical uses such as functional partitions in homes, but they had soon evolved into works of decorative art, being able to display paintings and calligraphy. It became very common for people to commission folding screens from artists.

            <b><u>Character Font</u></b><br><br>
            Fonts, as an important part of visual design and typography, were a crucial consideration for me. In two of my interviews, while discussing Chinese history, the interviewees emphasized the importance of Chinese calligraphy, a form of artistic expression deeply tied to Chinese culture and history. Chinese calligraphy is more than just a method of writing and communicating, but it is an art form that embodies the rhythm, emotion, techniques, and “philosophical depth" of Chinese culture, much like how a painting could be conveyed. Each brushstroke is filled with meaning, showing not only the character it forms but also the skill, personality, and mood of the calligrapher. This ancient tradition, which dates back thousands of years, has been an important form of Chinese artistic expression, influencing painting, design, and even modern typography. Calligraphy styles range from the highly structured kǎishū (standard script) to the more flowing and abstract cǎoshū (cursive script), each offering a unique way to express creativity and meaning.

              <b><u>Font Color</u></b><br><br>
              For Theme 2, I chose the color with hex code #f9dc69, which is a golden yellow shade that holds cultural significance. To ensure that the font color was still easy to read on this theme’s specific background, I made slight adjustments to achieve optimal contrast and clarity for users. The choice of golden yellow was definitely not random, as it was inspired by its historical significance in Chinese culture. Yellow has been a symbol of power, prosperity, and divine authority for thousands of years. During ancient times, it was closely associated with emperors since the Chinese word for yellow, huáng (黄), sounds like the Chinese word for "royal,” huáng (皇). In the imperial era, yellow was reserved for the emperor’s robes, and its use was strictly controlled to signify royalty and exclusivity.

          <u><h3><i>Broken-Blossoms</i> by D. W. Griffith</h3></u>
          <div class="interviewee-body">
              <div>
                  <p><b><u>What is it:</u></b><br>
                    <i>Broken Blossoms</i> or <i>The Yellow Man and the Girl</i>, is a 1919 American silent film directed by D. W. Griffith. It tells a story about a young girl, Lucy Burrows, who is abused by her father, and meets Cheng Huan, a kind Chinese man who falls in love with her.</p>
                  <p><b><u>Issues:</u></b><br>
                    <b>The Title:</b> The title can also be referred to as The Yellow Man and the Girl. Referring to the Chinese male protagonist simply as the "Yellow Man" rather than giving him a proper name reduces his identity to a racial caricature. This not only dehumanizes the character but also reinforces harmful Chinese stereotypes that reduce an entire culture to a single, offensive description.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Character vs Actor:</b> The character of the "Yellow Man," who is Chinese in the story, is played by a white actor in yellowface. This casting choice replaced authentic representation with harmful stereotypes by presenting a distorted, exaggerated, and often demeaning portrayal of Chinese people.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>The Portrayal of the Main Character:</b> The portrayal of the "Yellow Man" as a "sickly" and weak figure also draws upon stereotypes about Chinese men during that era, particularly in the period of the Opium Wars. The Opium Wars left a lasting impact on its society and were often used as a basis for portraying Chinese individuals as frail, morally corrupt, or helpless victims of addiction. This narrative negatively reinforces perceptions of Chinese men as these “sickly individuals,” which completely ignores the resilience, complexity, and humanity of their real experiences.

                    <br><br>
                    One specific controversy involved Yang’s comments about BTS, the globally popular South Korean boy band. In one of his stand-up performances, Yang recalls a moment when a 15-year-old white kid tried to introduce him to the members of BTS. The punchline comes when Yang jokes that, to him, all seven members of the group look the same, adding, “I didn’t wanna say it, I couldn’t say it as an Asian person. But they all just look like me." He then continues on the joke by saying he could turn the show into a BTS concert, pointing to himself, he says, “This is Jimmy,” before removing his glasses and saying, “and this is Jimin, right here. You don’t know.”
                    <br><br>
                    While some fans laughed at the joke, others were disappointed, arguing that it perpetuates harmful stereotypes that “all Asian people look the same,” a stereotype created and perpetuated by Western regions.

        <div class="interviewee-body">
            <div>
                <p><b><u>What is it:</u></b><br>
                  <i>Mulan</i> is a 1998 American animated film by Walt Disney Feature Animation. It tells a story of Mulan, a young Chinese woman, who disguises herself as a man to take her sick father's place in the army, defying societal expectations. </p>
                <p><b><u>Issues:</u></b><br>
                  <b>Her Character Design:</b> Mulan’s character design, particularly her facial features, perpetuates a Westernized view of Chinese people: a person with narrow eyes. This depiction aligns with stereotypes often imposed on East Asians in Western media. This stereotype is further amplified by gestures like people stretching out their eyes with their fingers to mock the “narrow eyes” look, which is still a very common gesture today for mockery.
                  <br><br>
                  <b>Mushu:</b> In Chinese culture, dragons are known to be powerful, majestic, and often associated with water, rain, and prosperity. A dragon associated with fire is very uncommon in Chinese culture, and it not only diverges from traditional symbolism but also challenges how Chinese audiences perceive dragons as divine protectors rather than comedic sidekicks. Dragons are not merely mythical creatures in Chinese culture, but are also deeply embedded in Chinese history, art, and imperial traditions, often symbolizing Chinese Emperors and the celestial mandate of heaven. The transformation of such a significant cultural symbol into a comedic character felt jarring to many Chinese audiences.
                  <br><br>
                  <b><i>Mulan</i> in China:</b> Unlike its success in the West, Mulan was incredibly unpopular in China, to the extent that it is one of the worst-performing movies in the Chinese market. Critics in China noted that the film’s attempt to merge Western storytelling with Chinese culture resulted in a portrayal that felt neither respectful nor representative.

                  One specific controversy involved Yang’s comments about BTS, the globally popular South Korean boy band. In one of his stand-up performances, Yang recalls a moment when a 15-year-old white kid tried to introduce him to the members of BTS. The punchline comes when Yang jokes that, to him, all seven members of the group look the same, adding, “I didn’t wanna say it, I couldn’t say it as an Asian person. But they all just look like me." He then continues on the joke by saying he could turn the show into a BTS concert, pointing to himself, he says, “This is Jimmy,” before removing his glasses and saying, “and this is Jimin, right here. You don’t know.”
                  <br><br>
                  While some fans laughed at the joke, others were disappointed, arguing that it perpetuates harmful stereotypes that “all Asian people look the same,” a stereotype created and perpetuated by Western regions.
