            "<i>The Kangxi Emperor's Southern Inspection Tour, Scroll Three: Ji'nan to Mount Tai</i>" by Wang Hui (<a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/49156" target="_blank">source</a>)<br><br>
            Commissioned by the Kangxi emperor in 1689, Wang Hui recorded the journey of the emperor's grand tour over a
            series of twelve oversize handscrolls. The scroll highlights the Kangxi Emperor's authority in southern China.
            This particular scroll is the third in the set, which highlights the emperor's visit to Mount Tai, where he
            performs rituals acknowledging the mandate of heaven and reaffirming
            his authority as a ruler.<br><br>

          <u><h3><i>Broken-Blossoms</i> by D. W. Griffith</h3></u>
          <div class="gingerbread-body">
              <div>
                  <p><b><u>What is it:</u></b><br>
                    <i>Broken Blossoms</i> or <i>The Yellow Man and the Girl</i>, is a 1919 American silent film directed by D. W. Griffith. It tells a story about a young girl, Lucy Burrows, who is abused by her father, and meets Cheng Huan, a kind Chinese man who falls in love with her.</p>
                  <p><b><u>Issues:</u></b><br>
                    <b>The Title:</b> The title can also be referred to as The Yellow Man and the Girl. Referring to the Chinese male protagonist simply as the "Yellow Man" rather than giving him a proper name reduces his identity to a racial caricature. This not only dehumanizes the character but also reinforces harmful Chinese stereotypes that reduce an entire culture to a single, offensive description.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Character vs Actor:</b> The character of the "Yellow Man," who is Chinese in the story, is played by a white actor in yellowface. This casting choice replaced authentic representation with harmful stereotypes by presenting a distorted, exaggerated, and often demeaning portrayal of Chinese people.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>The Portrayal of the Main Character:</b> The portrayal of the "Yellow Man" as a "sickly" and weak figure also draws upon stereotypes about Chinese men during that era, particularly in the period of the Opium Wars. The Opium Wars left a lasting impact on its society and were often used as a basis for portraying Chinese individuals as frail, morally corrupt, or helpless victims of addiction. This narrative negatively reinforces perceptions of Chinese men as these “sickly individuals,” which completely ignores the resilience, complexity, and humanity of their real experiences.

                  <p><b><u>Who is he:</u></b><br>
                    Jimmy O. Yang is a Hong Kong-American stand-up comedian.</p>
                  <p><b><u>Issues:</u></b><br>
                    <b>Self-Depracating Humor:</b> Yang's comedic style often involves making fun of his own culture
                    <br><br>
                    One specific controversy involved Yang’s comments about BTS, the globally popular South Korean boy band. In one of his stand-up performances, Yang recalls a moment when a 15-year-old white kid tried to introduce him to the members of BTS. The punchline comes when Yang jokes that, to him, all seven members of the group look the same, adding, “I didn’t wanna say it, I couldn’t say it as an Asian person. But they all just look like me." He then continues on the joke by saying he could turn the show into a BTS concert, pointing to himself, he says, “This is Jimmy,” before removing his glasses and saying, “and this is Jimin, right here. You don’t know.”
                    <br><br>
                    While some fans laughed at the joke, others were disappointed, arguing that it perpetuates harmful stereotypes that “all Asian people look the same,” a stereotype created and perpetuated by Western regions.
